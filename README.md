# Flipkart-Data-Analysis-using-python-
The Flipkart Mobile Data Analysis Project involves scraping mobile phone data from Flipkart, 
cleaning the data, and performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to derive meaningful insights.

1. Data Sources: The data used in this project was scraped from the GitHub, Websites,flipkart focusing on smart mobile phones with varying price ranges.

Tool Used:
  Python (specifically Jupyter Notebook)
  BeautifulSoup (for web scraping)
  Requests (for handling HTTP requests)
  Pandas (for data manipulation)
  Matplotlib (for data visualization)

2. Process Overview:
  Web Scraping: The web scraping script collects data for each mobile phone, including product name, price, description, and ratings.
  Cleaning: The cleaning script processes the raw data to handle missing values, extract relevant information (such as RAM and ROM from descriptions), and standardize the data format.
  EDA: The exploratory data analysis script visualizes the cleaned data to uncover patterns and insights. Visualizations include price distribution, brand performance, and ratings distribution.

3. Insights and Key Findings:
  Pricing Trends: The price distribution reveals a wide range, with budget and mid-range mobiles being prominent. Premium brands show higher price points with distinct features.
  Brand Popularity: Certain brands dominate the market share, indicating strong brand loyalty and market presence.
  Feature Impact: Features like RAM, storage, and battery capacity correlate positively with price. Higher-rated mobiles tend to have better specifications, justifying their higher prices.
  Customer Insights: Ratings and reviews highlight the importance of specific features like battery life, camera quality, and performance.
                     Positive reviews often align with higher-priced models, suggesting perceived value   for money.
4. Project Impact:
  Scraped data for over various products like electronics , clothings etc , including product details.
  Utilized BeautifulSoup and Requests for efficient data gathering.
  Processed raw data to handle missing values using Pandas.
  Visualized insights through charts using Matplotlib.
